Users that are NOT admins (subscribers, ..) are not allowed to modify their own profiles. "Profile" tab is removed from wordpress admin.

== Description ==

Do you offer a test user to potential clients for a Wordpress site? Then you really need "WP User Vandalism Protection" plugin, to protect yourself from bad people that will modify your test account.

"WP User Vandalism Protection" removes "Profile" tab from admin bar and side menu, where users can edit their profile and kill profile page if user isn't an administrator.

Why did we do it?
In order to let potential clients to test the plugins we are creating, we offered a test site, with a test subscriber user. We communicated the user and password for the test user to potential clients.
So far so good.
The problem was that some people, once they logged in, they changed the name, email and password, which was very annoying, because the rest of potential clients could not get in to test the product anymore.

So we had to come up with a plugin that protect the test users, not to be hijacked by bad people. That's why we did "WP User Vandalism Protection".


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-user-vandalism-protection` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the "WP User Vandalism Protection" plugin in your WordPress administration interface.

3. Done!
